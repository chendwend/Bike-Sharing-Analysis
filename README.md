# Bike Sharing Analysis
Analysis and Prediction of the Kaggle Bike sharing Dataset.  
Code written in R.

## Task Description
Bike-sharing systems are a common transportation solution around the world.  
They allow bicycles to be rented for temporary use, thereby promoting green transportation,  
reducing road congestion, and improving public health.  

The demand for bike rentals is related to environmental conditions and time,  
such as weather conditions and day of the week. Companies that operate  
bike-sharing systems are interested in understanding rental behaviors based on  
parameters measured in the sharing systems in order to make informed business decisions. 

This work tries to address the following two challenges:
1. What are the factors that predict the demand for shared bikes on a daily basis?
2. What are the factors that predict the likelihood of high demand for shared bikes among casual users during the summer season, while defining the term likelihood of high demand?

## Dataset 
This work analyzes the 
[kaggle daily rental bike sharing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset).   
It contains daily total rentals, taken between 2011-2012, extracted from Capital bikeshare system.
